# Ticket-Management-Rust

## Overview

Ticket-Management-Rust is a ticketing system built on smart contracts. It enables efficient management of events, users, and tickets by utilizing stable data structures and Candid serialization, ensuring compatibility with the Internet Computer framework. The system provides comprehensive support for CRUD operations and relationship management.
## Prerequisites

- Rust
- Internet Computer SDK
- IC CDK

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/foryouflowerai/e-ticketer-ICP.git
    cd e-ticketer-ICP
    ```

## Running the Project Locally

To test your project locally, use the following commands:

```bash
# Start the replica in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploy your canisters to the replica and generate your Candid interface
dfx deploy
```

After deployment, access your application at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

To generate a new Candid interface after backend changes, run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

To start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Frontend Environment Variables

If hosting frontend code without DFX, adjust the environment to prevent fetching the root key in production:

- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `production` if using Webpack.
- Replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in autogenerated declarations with your method.
- Set `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override` in `dfx.json` to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK`.
- Write a custom `createActor` constructor.
